		<p>He is an American Staffordshire terrier and boxer mix. He was born in 2010, but we do not know where he was born or who he lived with for the first year and a half of his life. In the summer of 2011, he was adopted by his forever family, the York family, and he has filled our days with love and happiness ever since.</p>
		<p><br></p>
		<p>The day he was adopted, we were surprised as he immediately bounded out of the car and into our house, running around and almost <em>bouncing</em> off the walls with energy. At first, we were not quite sure what to make of him, but the first night when he curled up into a little ball at the end of our bed and slept peacefully, we quickly began to warm up to him. Over the next few days, we even thought something was wrong with him, as when he wagged his tail, his whole lower body would squirm and wiggle uncontrollably, but we soon realized that it was a normal reaction for a Boxer and that he was just a <em>very</em> happy dog.</p>
		<p><br></p>
		<p>Over the next 10 years that he has been with us, we have loved his big, brown and soulful eyes and how he sprints excitedly to greet us when we come home. He can still be energetic, but he also has a very calm, relaxing demeanor. Although he is not technically an emotional support dog, he has been one to our family ever since we brought him home.</p>
